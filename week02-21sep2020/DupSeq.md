# DupSeq (Duplex Sequencing)

## Overview

DupSeq is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique, which enables detection of very rare true mutations with higher accuracy and lower number of error rates. 
In order to overcome the high error-rate of NGS, both strands of DNA are tagged with complementary tags, sequenced and then with the help of their tags compared to each other. 
If both strands contain a particular mutation, then it is a true variant. In this way, it can avoid PCR, sequencing or other background errors.
