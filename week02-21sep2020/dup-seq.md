# Duplex Sequencing (Dup-Seq)

Schmitt, Michael W., Scott R. Kennedy, Jesse J. Salk, Edward J. Fox, Joseph B. Hiatt, and Lawrence A. Loeb. “[Detection of Ultra-rare Mutations by Next-generation Sequencing.](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/36/14508.full)” _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ 109, no. 36 (September 4, 2012): 14508–14513. doi:10.1073/pnas.1208715109.

## Summary
Dup-Seq looks at mutations on complementary strands by independently tagging and sequencing each of the two strands of a DNA duplex. Compared to common sequencing methods that only use one strand, this approach greatly reduces sequencing errors, making it effective in rare mutation detection. Furthermore, mutations appearing in only one of the two strands of duplex DNA can be utilized to identify sites of DNA damage.

## Making the link
DNA sequencing (and read alignment) -> mutation frequency and pattern detection -> classification methods (tree-based methods, multinomial logistic regression, etc.).
