# How it works

Smart-Seq-II generates barcoded cDNA libraries from very low input for sequencing on illumina platforms. Smart-Seq-II (Picelli) can generate sequencing libraries from polyadenylated RNA at the single cell resolution. The data generated from the sequencing of these libraries are primarily used to compare differential expression, identify genes and perform transcriptome-wide profiling in rare cells.
